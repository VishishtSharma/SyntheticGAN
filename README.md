# generation-of-synthetic-satellite-images-using-GANs

The field of remote sensing uses imagery captured 
from satellites, aircrafts, and UAVs in order to observe and 
analyze the Earth. Many remote sensing applications that are 
used today employ deep learning models that require large 
amounts of data or specific types of data. The lack of data can 
hinder model performance. A generative adversarial network 
(GAN) is a deep learning model that can generate synthetic data 
and can be used as a method for data augmentation to increase 
performance of data reliant deep learning models. GANs are also 
capable of image-to-image translation such as transforming a 
satellite image containing cloud coverage into one without clouds. 
These possibilities have led to many new and exciting GAN 
applications. This project aims to explore one such application of 
GANs in the area of satellite imagery, generation of synthetic 
images using data augmentation ability of GAN. The tasks carried 
out were accessing the data from an open access data source, 
preparing the data as per our requirements, using them to 
generate mask layers and finally translating the masks to output 
synthetic images
